            <p>This is my journey of how I made this site :-</p><br>
            <p><strong>Setting up Hugo :</strong> I had to install hugo first using the linux commands [sudo apt install hugo] and then I had to create a new site in my directory to get my things that are necessary for hugo site.</p>
            <p><strong>Choosing a theme :</strong> I spent like a whole day on deciding what theme I want to use cause, I wanted to make my best impression and also I wanted a sophisticated site anyways.</p>
            <p><strong>Changing content :</strong> This is one of the most tiring and boring parts of this tasks, as I had to change each and everything in the website with information related to me and search for the right directory where the proper assests are stored which I failed parially because I could not find the correct directory for the images used.</p>
            <p><strong>Making the Blog :</strong> While making the blog I searched a lot as where to add the blog, do I have to create a new file and then include in the index.html, all such doubts where eating my brain. I then decided to modify the contact section to the blog section which you are reading.</p>
            <p><strong>Issues faced :</strong> I kinda faced lots of issues but here is one which I got frustrated with, in this code if you add an apostrophe, it kinda messes up the code and does not give the code, I then understood for certain symbols and characters we need to using escape characters just like in any other language.</p>
            <p><strong>Finishing up :</strong> After successfully editing the code and making all the links functional I uploaded this websites's files into a respository I made abd hosted this website as the subdomain of the other website in its main branch.</p>
